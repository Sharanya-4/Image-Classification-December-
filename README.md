# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset

# Overview
This repository contains code for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. 
The goal of this project is to build and train a deep learning model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

# Dataset
Download the CIFAR-10 dataset from the official website or use the provided script:

* Code: from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
* Link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

# Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of simple artificial neural networks which consists of conv2D layers, MaxPooling layers, Flattern Layers and Dense Layers.
